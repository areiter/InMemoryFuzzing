		gif2png -- GIF to PNG graphics file conversion

The gif2png program converts files from the Graphic Interchange Format
to Portable Network Graphics.  It can be built under any Unix, or
under MS-DOS or Windows using djgpp, or using Borland C. I don't know
when the djgpp or Borland builds were last tested.  You will need
libpng at version 1.0.5 or later to build this program.

Some pre-1.0.0 versions of gif2png had a bug that messed up color
conversions that followed grayscale conversions.  There has also been
at least one relevant bug-fix in zlib, so if you are using gif2png (or
any other png writing program using zlib) with a version below 0.95,
you should update.

Note: Some ImageMagick 4.2.x versions (including the 4.2.2 shipped
with Red Hat 6.1) have a bug displaying grayscale PNGs that makes it
look like gif2png is broken.  It's not.  This bug is fixed in the
ImageMagick 5.2.2 shipped with Red Hat 7.0.

This distribution also supplies web2png, a Python front end for
gif2png which automagically converts entire web hierarchies (the
graphics files themselves and references to them in web pages).
Note: this script requires Python 1.5.2.

These programs has a home site at <http://www.catb.org/~esr/gif2png/>.
